# React Dark Mode (Custom Hooks)

Data persistence is a huge deal. If you want an app or website to behave in a certain way, wouldn't it be cool if the program was nice enough to remember your preference? Enter local storage.

This app combines custom hooks with local storage to set-up a dark mode feature. The custom hooks take local storage's key/value pair as parameters in order to make this feature happen.

## How the App Works
